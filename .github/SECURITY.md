# Security Policy

## Overview

The QR Info Portal project takes security seriously. This document outlines our security practices, how to report vulnerabilities, and what to expect from our security response.

## Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | ✅ Yes             |
| < 1.0   | ❌ No              |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

### How to Report

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities through one of the following methods:

1. **GitHub Security Advisories** (Preferred)
   - Go to the [Security tab](../../security) of this repository
   - Click "Report a vulnerability"
   - Fill out the form with details

2. **Email** (Alternative)
   - Send an email to: **security@[your-domain]**
   - Include "QR Info Portal Security" in the subject line

### What to Include

Please include the following information in your report:

- **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
- **Impact**: What could an attacker achieve?
- **Reproduction**: Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- **Affected Components**: Which parts of the system are affected
- **Suggested Fix**: If you have ideas for how to fix the issue
- **CVSS Score**: If you can calculate one

### What to Expect

| Timeline | Action |
|----------|---------|
| < 24 hours | Acknowledgment of your report |
| < 72 hours | Initial assessment and priority classification |
| < 7 days | Detailed response and remediation plan |
| < 30 days | Security fix released (for confirmed vulnerabilities) |

## Security Measures

### Application Security

- **Authentication**: Admin interface protected with HTTP Basic Auth
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- **Output Encoding**: Template auto-escaping prevents XSS
- **Database Security**: Parameterized queries prevent SQL injection
- **File Upload**: No file upload functionality to prevent malicious uploads
- **Session Management**: Secure session configuration with proper flags

### Infrastructure Security

- **Container Security**: Non-root user, minimal base image, security scanning
- **Dependencies**: Regular dependency updates and vulnerability scanning
- **Secrets Management**: No hardcoded secrets, environment variable configuration
- **Logging**: Security-relevant events are logged without sensitive data
- **Network Security**: Minimal attack surface, HTTPS recommended for production

### Development Security

- **Code Scanning**: Automated SAST with multiple tools (Bandit, CodeQL, Semgrep)
- **Dependency Scanning**: Daily vulnerability checks with Safety, pip-audit
- **Container Scanning**: Docker image security scanning with Trivy
- **Secret Scanning**: Automated detection of leaked secrets
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Local security checks before code commits

## Security Features

### Automated Security

- ✅ **Dependabot**: Automated dependency updates with security prioritization
- ✅ **CodeQL**: GitHub's semantic code analysis
- ✅ **Secret Scanning**: Automatic detection of leaked secrets
- ✅ **Vulnerability Alerts**: Immediate notifications for known vulnerabilities
- ✅ **Security Advisories**: Structured vulnerability disclosure

### Manual Security Processes

- 🔍 **Regular Security Reviews**: Monthly security assessment
- 🔄 **Secret Rotation**: Quarterly rotation of sensitive credentials
- 📊 **Security Metrics**: Tracking and reporting of security posture
- 🎯 **Threat Modeling**: Regular review of potential attack vectors

## Security Best Practices for Contributors

### Code Security

```python
# ✅ Good: Parameterized queries
user = db.session.execute(
    text("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = :user_id"),
    {"user_id": user_id}
).first()

# ❌ Bad: String formatting
user = db.session.execute(f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {user_id}")
```

```python
# ✅ Good: Environment variables for secrets
SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY')

# ❌ Bad: Hardcoded secrets
SECRET_KEY = 'hardcoded-secret-key'
```

```python
# ✅ Good: Input validation
from werkzeug.utils import secure_filename
filename = secure_filename(uploaded_file.filename)

# ❌ Bad: Direct user input usage  
filename = request.files['file'].filename
```

### Configuration Security

- Use environment variables for all sensitive configuration
- Validate all configuration values at startup
- Use secure defaults (e.g., debug=False in production)
- Implement proper error handling that doesn't leak information

## Incident Response

### Classification

| Severity | Definition | Response Time |
|----------|------------|---------------|
| **Critical** | Remote code execution, authentication bypass | < 4 hours |
| **High** | Data exposure, privilege escalation | < 24 hours |
| **Medium** | Information disclosure, DoS | < 72 hours |
| **Low** | Minor security improvements | < 1 week |

### Response Process

1. **Assessment**: Evaluate severity and impact
2. **Containment**: Immediate measures to limit exposure
3. **Investigation**: Root cause analysis
4. **Remediation**: Develop and test fix
5. **Communication**: Notify affected users if necessary
6. **Prevention**: Improve processes to prevent recurrence
