# Security Guidelines

This document outlines security measures and best practices for QR-Info-Portal.

## üîí Security Overview

QR-Info-Portal is designed with security as a priority, especially considering its use in medical facilities. The application follows industry best practices for web security while maintaining usability.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Features

### Authentication & Authorization
- **Admin Panel**: Protected with HTTP Basic Authentication
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling with Flask-Session
- **Password Storage**: Passwords stored as environment variables, never in code
- **CSRF Protection**: All forms protected against Cross-Site Request Forgery

### Data Protection
- **No Patient Data**: System designed to never store patient information
- **Minimal Data Collection**: Only operational data (schedules, status)
- **Privacy by Design**: GDPR/PDPA compliant architecture
- **Secure Communications**: HTTPS recommended for production

### Input Validation
- **Form Validation**: Server-side validation for all inputs
- **SQL Injection Protection**: Using SQLAlchemy ORM with parameterized queries
- **XSS Prevention**: Template auto-escaping enabled
- **File Upload Restrictions**: Limited to safe image formats for QR codes

## üö® Security Best Practices

### Deployment Security

1. **Environment Variables**
   ```bash
   # Never commit .env files
   ADMIN_USERNAME=your_admin_user
   ADMIN_PASSWORD=strong_password_here
   SECRET_KEY=generate_random_secret_key
   DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///secure_path/portal.db
   ```

2. **HTTPS Configuration**
   - Always use HTTPS in production
   - Configure proper SSL certificates
   - Enable HSTS headers

3. **Firewall Rules**
   - Limit access to admin endpoints
   - Configure rate limiting
   - Block suspicious IPs

### Code Security

1. **Dependency Management**
   ```bash
   # Regularly update dependencies
   pip install --upgrade pip
   pip-review --auto
   
   # Check for vulnerabilities
   pip install safety
   safety check
   ```

2. **Secret Management**
   - Use environment variables for secrets
   - Rotate keys regularly
   - Never hardcode credentials

3. **Error Handling**
   - Don't expose stack traces in production
   - Log errors securely
   - Custom error pages

### Database Security

1. **Access Control**
   - Restrict database file permissions
   - Use read-only connections where possible
   - Regular backups with encryption

2. **Query Safety**
   ```python
   # Good - Using ORM
   user = User.query.filter_by(username=username).first()
   
   # Bad - String concatenation
   # query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" + username + "'"
   ```

## üîç Security Checklist

### Pre-Deployment
- [ ] Change all default passwords
- [ ] Generate new SECRET_KEY
- [ ] Review and update .env.example
- [ ] Enable HTTPS
- [ ] Configure firewall rules
- [ ] Set up monitoring/logging
- [ ] Review file permissions
- [ ] Update all dependencies

### Regular Maintenance
- [ ] Monthly dependency updates
- [ ] Quarterly security audits
- [ ] Review access logs
- [ ] Test backup restoration
- [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] Security training for admins

## üö´ Common Vulnerabilities to Avoid

### 1. Injection Attacks
- Always use parameterized queries
- Validate and sanitize all inputs
- Use ORM methods instead of raw SQL

### 2. Authentication Flaws
- Implement rate limiting on login
- Use strong password policies
- Enable account lockout mechanisms

### 3. Sensitive Data Exposure
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest
- Use HTTPS for data in transit
- Implement proper access controls

### 4. Security Misconfiguration
- Disable debug mode in production
- Remove default accounts
- Keep software updated

## üÜò Security Incident Response

### If a Security Issue is Discovered:

1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Isolate affected systems
   - Document the issue
   - Notify system administrator

2. **Assessment**
   - Determine scope of impact
   - Identify affected data/users
   - Review logs for timeline

3. **Remediation**
   - Apply security patches
   - Update configurations
   - Reset affected credentials

4. **Communication**
   - Notify affected parties
   - Document lessons learned
   - Update security procedures

## üìû Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability:

1. **Do NOT** create a public GitHub issue
2. **Email** security@example.com with details
3. **Include**:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
